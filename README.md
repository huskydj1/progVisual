# Program Visualizer

## Function:
- Create a graphic visualizing basic data structures and algorithms of programs
- Make it easier for programmers to run, debug, and understand code

## Completed Features:
- Array:
    - Display/Refresh
    - Parameterize Aspects of Array
- Generic types

## Features in Progress:
- Implement mainWindow:
  - Capability of adding/removing variables to track in the main window
- ArrayList
  - Each instance stores history of changes. This should be used in paintComponent to create a scrollable log of 
  different states of the ArrayList
  - Learn about interfaces and how I can use that to add my operations to ArrayList. Essentially, people can 
  just modify their ArrayList interface and their program will work the same except now they will have 
  my visuals
 
## Future Features:
- Implement for other data structures:
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Deque

## "Reach" Features
- Graphs (+ arranging them as trees, undirected/directed, etc)
