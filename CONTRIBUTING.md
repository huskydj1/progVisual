# Contributing Guidelines

## Getting Started
To get started, please make sure that you understand the [README's contents](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual/blob/master/README.md). In particular, please follow the guide's instructions to install and use the library, so that you have experience with it before you contribute.

## Pull Requests

### Work Suggestions
[The issues tab](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual/issues) contains suggestions for contributing. Please mention and link to the issue that your pull request works on or solves. For example, your comment might include:

  "This pull request adds an observer class for deques, as recommended by issue ['Create observer classes for more data-structures](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual/issues/2).'"

Please only add pull-requests to the master branch if your code is fully-functional. If not, we would appreciate it if you added it another branch, existing or created by you.

### Documentation
Documentation is also very helpful in keeping our library easily accessible and understandable for newcomers! Even if not explicitly stated in a git issue, feel free to write documentation for existing code. For methods and classes, please use JavaDocs! If you are infamiliar with them and would like to learn more, here are a few resources:
- ["How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool" - Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html)
- ["Java - Documentation Comments" - TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm)
- ["How to Use JavaDoc to Document Your Classes" - Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/how-to-use-javadoc-to-document-your-classes/)

## Bugs/Feedback
Contributions in the form of bug reports or feedback are always helpful! Feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual#Feedback) or [create a git issue](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual/issues)!

If you are reporting a bug, you should include a description of the bug and a specific example, with proof, of that bug disrupting the library's intended purpose, so that we can try to fix the issue.

Feedback, in the form of questions, comments, concerns, or general ideas, are always helpful! We elaborate more about these in our [README](https://github.com/huskydj1/progVisual#Feedback).
